# TeamBoard
TeamBoard is an internal communication backend that allows employees to:  ○ Create and manage projects.  ○ Join multiple projects.  ○ Post messages and discussions within each project.  ○ Search messages by keyword.  ● It mirrors how modern organizations use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams — but in a simplified form.
